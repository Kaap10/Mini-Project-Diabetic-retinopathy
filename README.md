# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection with CNN

This project is a **Diabetic Retinopathy Detection System** that uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify retinal images. It provides a simple web-based interface for users to upload retinal images and get predictions on the presence of diabetic retinopathy.

---

## 🏗 **Architecture**
1. **Machine Learning**:  
   - A CNN model is built using **TensorFlow** and **Keras** to classify retinal images from the **Messidor dataset**.  
   - Preprocessing steps include resizing images and normalizing pixel values.  
   - The model predicts the severity of diabetic retinopathy.  

2. **Backend**:  
   - The backend is developed using **Flask**, which acts as a bridge between the ML model and the frontend.  
   - It handles image upload, model inference, and result transmission to the client.

3. **Frontend**:  
   - The user interface is built with **HTML** and **CSS**.  
   - Users can upload retinal images and view the classification results.

## 💻 **Tech Stack**
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, Keras, Python
- **Backend**: Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS

## 🗂 **Dataset**
- **Messidor Dataset**:  
  A publicly available dataset containing retinal images used for detecting diabetic retinopathy.  
  - Images are preprocessed and resized to fit the CNN input shape.  
  - Dataset split: 80% training, 20% validation.

---

## 🚀 **Features**
- Upload retinal images through a user-friendly interface.  
- Real-time prediction of diabetic retinopathy severity.  
- Lightweight Flask backend for seamless communication between frontend and ML model.
